### Custom MJML Cover Image

On MJML App currently, there no cover image option to add for the specific project, and easy to recognize.

There is a simple way to add‚Äîfirst download ready-made templates from here.

Most important is file name structure `0-` and not touch `<mj-column padding-top="8px">`

`0-mjml-cover.mjml` | `0-project-name.mjml` | `0-cover-image.mjml`

Few steps to-do

1. Open [Sketch app](https://www.sketch.com/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and do your customization and export.
2. Upload on your favorite file hosting website. Mine is [Imgur](http://imgur.com/).
3. Just replace `demo-URL` with `your-URL`. (you can skip step 2 replace `demo-URL` with `local path`).
4. Save it and hit `command+r` to refresh the app.
5. Woohoo!! üéâ Cover Image now update.

And, I added some design template hope you guys like it. üòÅ More will add soon

If you want to customize on code there few mjml code add.

`<mj-body background-color="#">`

`border-radius="70px"`
